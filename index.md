## Welcome to my ePortfolio

## Introduction
I started my Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University back in September of 2018. In 2015, I started at Pueblo Community College in Pueblo Colorado, then I transferred to Unversity of Colorado Colorado Springs for Computer engineering intent for about a year and a half. I then decided to transfer to SNHU online to pursue my bachelor's degree in computer science with the concentration of Software engineering.

### Educational Learning Experience

Throughout the computer science program, I have gained a lot of skills. Most importantly, I have learned not to ever give up because the end result always pays off. I remember failing several times when writing software code but I learned from my mistakes and learned how to avoid them. I also gained good attention to details skill while doing visual inspection of software code. Growing up I did not have access to a computer and did not know too much about technology, that is one the reasons I chose to pursue a degeree in the computer science industry. I wanted to challenge myself in an ongoing field to help keeping me connected with the most recent trends. Honestly, I am glad I did because now I see how technology has changed our world today with much more to come. In the computer science industry I have learned some good practices, such as, testing the code often during the software development life cycle (SDLC) and not wait till the end because it can save developers time and money. Also, having good syntax and follow proper standards are very important. I enjoyed doing code reviews for both myself and other peers because that helped me better understand data structures and bad practices. I learned how to break something and make it work in order to know when it is vulnearble. The software development life cycle (SDLC) has changed my views on several different areas and it taught me how to work in a team. One of the lessons learned is to not write code in a hurry and always have good planning for a successful product.
