## CS-499 ePortfolio
## Author: Pierre Mathurin

## Introduction
I started my Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University back in September of 2018. In 2015, I started at Pueblo Community College in Pueblo Colorado, then I transferred to University of Colorado at Colorado Springs for Computer engineering intent for about a year and a half. I then decided to transfer to SNHU online to pursue my bachelor's degree in computer science with the concentration of Software engineering.

## Educational Learning Experience

Throughout the computer science program, I have gained a lot of skills. Most importantly, I have learned not to ever give up because the end result always pays off. I remember failing several times when writing software code but I learned from my mistakes and learned how to avoid them. I also gained good attention to details skill while doing visual inspection of software code. Growing up I did not have access to a computer and did not know too much about technology, that is one the reasons I chose to pursue a degree in the computer science industry. I wanted to challenge myself in an ongoing field to help keeping me connected with the most recent trends. Honestly, I am glad I did because now I see how technology has changed our world today with much more to come. In the computer science industry, I have learned some good practices, such as, testing the code often during the software development life cycle (SDLC) and not wait till the end because it can save developers time and money. Also, having good syntax and follow proper standards are very important. I enjoyed doing code reviews for both myself and other peers because that helped me better understand data structures and bad practices. I learned how to break something and make it work in order to know when it is vulnerable. The software development life cycle (SDLC) has changed my views on several different areas and it taught me how to work in a team. One of the lessons learned is to not write code in a hurry and always have good planning for a successful product.

## Portfolio Overview

Throughout the Computer Science program, the combined courses have given me the necessary skills and knowledge to land a career in the industry. In the CS-410 Software Reverse Engineering course, I learned about Data structures and Algorithms and how they are used for analyzing large volumes of data. This course primarily focused on common data structure operations, including searches and sorts. Data structure and Algorithm can be implemented in any programming language and therefore is crucial when developing code to handle data. This course has helped me understand how to write efficient code for handling data with minimal effort by providing me the set of techniques.

In CS-350 Emerging Systems Architectures and Technologies, I learned the importance of emerging systems architectures and technologies and its performance and the software/hardware interface. This course focused on analyzing fundamental issues in architecture design and the impact on application performance to enable better understanding of the concepts. I enjoyed this course as it gave me experience in determining when to implement architectures and technologies to fulfill business needs. Also, writing software code to interface with embedded systems to control hardware and software components.

Additionally, CS-405 Secure Coding focused on common security vulnerabilities that are found in software. I learned some techniques and strategies to develop robust and secure code, leveraging secure programming principles. I also learned to analyze source code through manual and automated testing methods for the identification of potential vulnerabilities and code weaknesses using best practices and industry standards.

Generally, all of the combined courses in the computer science program have given me the opportunity to understand the software development and how to communicate with clients to help meet their needs.
