								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I started my Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University back in September of 2018. In 2015, I started at Pueblo Community College in Pueblo Colorado, then I transferred to University of Colorado at Colorado Springs for Computer engineering intent for about a year and a half. I then decided to transfer to SNHU online to pursue my bachelor's degree in computer science with the concentration of Software engineering.</p>
								<h3 class="major">Educational Experience</h3>
								<p>Throughout the computer science program, I have gained a lot of skills. Most importantly, I have learned not to ever give up because the end result always pays off. I remember failing several times when writing software code but I learned from my mistakes and learned how to avoid them. I also gained good attention to details skill while doing visual inspection of software code. Growing up I did not have access to a computer and did not know too much about technology, that is one the reasons I chose to pursue a degree in the computer science industry. I wanted to challenge myself in an ongoing field to help keeping me connected with the most recent trends. Honestly, I am glad I did because now I see how technology has changed our world today with much more to come. In the computer science industry, I have learned some good practices, such as, testing the code often during the software development life cycle (SDLC) and not wait till the end because it can save developers time and money. Also, having good syntax and follow proper standards are very important. I enjoyed doing code reviews for both myself and other peers because that helped me better understand data structures and bad practices. I learned how to break something and make it work in order to know when it is vulnerable. The software development life cycle (SDLC) has changed my views on several different areas and it taught me how to work in a team. One of the lessons learned is to not write code in a hurry and always have good planning for a successful product.</p>
								<h3 class="major">Portfolio Overview</h3>
								<p>Throughout the computer science program, the combined courses have given me the necessary skills and knowledge to land a career in the industry. In the CS-410 Software Reverse Engineering course, I learned about Data structures and Algorithms and how they are used for analyzing large volumes of data. This course primarily focused on common data structure operations, including searches and sorts. Data structure and Algorithm can be implemented in any programming language and therefore is crucial when developing code to handle data. This course has helped me understand how to write efficient code for handling data with minimal effort by providing me the set of techniques. <br>	 In CS-350 Emerging Systems Architectures and Technologies, I learned the importance of emerging systems architectures and technologies and its performance and the software/hardware interface. This course focused on analyzing fundamental issues in architecture design and the impact on application performance to enable better understanding of the concepts. I enjoyed this course as it gave me experience in determining when to implement architectures and technologies to fulfill business needs. Also, writing software code to interface with embedded systems to control hardware and software components. <br> Additionally, CS-405 Secure Coding focused on common security vulnerabilities that are found in software. I learned some techniques and strategies to develop robust and secure code, leveraging secure programming principles. I also learned to analyze source code through manual and automated testing methods for the identification of potential vulnerabilities and code weaknesses using best practices and industry standards.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Code Review</h2>
								<h3 class="major">Refinement Plan & Code Review</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h4 class="major">Category One: Software Engineering/Design</h4>
								<p>Software engineering/design is the process of developing software programs or applications to help achieving certain goals. Throughout my college career in the computer science program, I have acquired some knowledge and some best practices to develop and design computer applications. One application that I created was an inventory app to track inventory in a warehouse. This was a simple program I did for school that was written in java programming language. The users had to login or create an account if never logged in before in order to access any content in the application. My plan in this course is to enhance this application by improving the logic flow and fix some of the possible logic errors. I also need to make sure that the mechanisms for adding and removing items from the inventory are properly stored.</p>
								<h4 class="major">Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structures</h4>
								<p>The algorithms and data structures for this application seem to be very simple. An algorithm is used to display the items from the inventory if the user’s credentials are matched. That is after the user is logged in, all the items from the inventory are displayed then, he or she is prompted to three different options from the available mechanisms; add or remove items, increase or decrease items, then setting up alert when a specific item reaches zero. I plan on enhancing the algorithm to better retrieve information from the inventory by modifying the data structures using array lists to store the inventory items. Also, I want to write an algorithm for setting up the alert.</p>
								<h4 class="major">Category Three: Databases</h4>
								<p>The inventory management application is simple app that was built to manage inventory items in warehouse. The main users for the application are people who work in warehouse/store which will be in control of inventory, such as store managers, and any authorized employees. The application should be able to hold as many users as possible and users will be able to view, add and remove items from the store. <br> The application has a security feature which means only users who have an account will have access to the content of the application. If users do not have an account, they will be prompt to create their account with their credentials, otherwise the application will not allow them to access any of its content. The application uses text file to store the users’ information and the files will be stored in a local storage on the local machine, which forces the user to only access the application with the specific device. My goal is to have those text files stored on a web-based database to provide more flexibility for the user, that is the user can access the application if downloaded across other devices. Also, having this flexibility will make it easier for the backend to do any improvements to the application when necessary. However, I am concerned about some artifacts that I think need some improvements as I am not very experienced on building software applications. I know that my application needs to have a more structured coding practice, better storage methods and data structures. I plan on making these improvements to the application to assure a better result after launching. <br><br> Based on some research I did on the method I use to store the users’ information; I found some downsides to that method even though it seems to have good advantages. My first concern is since these files will be stored locally, this makes the application more vulnerable and unauthorized people can easily hack some sensitive data such as, usernames and passwords. Also, managing these types of data does not seem to be an easy task after having several users. Whereas, web-based databases today offer several features that can handle these tasks better and more secure. <br><br> This was not an easy step within the enhancements that had to do. I had different ideas on which database that I was going to use for the application, then I came across an easy, user friendly web-based database called XAMPP. I was excited as I started progressing through this improvement. I went ahead and created several examples to see what the data would look like by creating tables to store the information. For the users, I had a user table with 3 columns to hold their name, password, employee ID. Then, I created other tables to test out the items by having an item table with category, quantity, price, and date. Therefore, these enhancements will make the inventory application more secure and easy to manage and organize the data being stored. One main advantage of the web-based database, it will be simple to import and export files, backups can also be done to assure any loss of data. At this point, most of goals for a database have been met and I will keep learning more on how to organize the data and make it look clean, easy to read and manage. <br><br> <nav> <ul> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzlxOdC1ap8&feature=youtu.be </nav> </ul> </p>

The targeted users are anyone who works at a warehouse and is in control of inventory, such as store manager, stocker, and other authorized employees. The application has the following requirements: <br> 	A screen with user login, with the option of creating an account for first time users. <br> 	A grid that shows the inventory items in the store with the mechanism to add and remove items in different categories. <br>	A screen that shows the items to add to grid. <br> 	A grid with the database. <br>	Also, a mechanism is required to send an alert to the user when a specific item has reached zero. <br> For this inventory application, I developed it from scratch and as I am going through it after getting hint on code review, I find some areas that needed to be enhanced, to be added and/or other parts of code to be removed in order to enhance its working. Learning software design specifically in this course, helps me better understand the design process, database and data structure I realize that I can make the application more interesting and attractive to users. I started by commenting the code as it is vital in computer programming, this project has really helped improving my skills a bit higher since almost all the files needed to be commented fully, that way if anyone who does not know anything about coding can better understand the function of each block of code in the whole project. Also, since logical errors cannot be detected by the compiler this makes it a little harder to remove logic errors and may even leave the deployed application with the errors. Additionally, the project has given me the opportunity to work with external files. In the previous version of the application I did not properly include external files, like text files or database files where history will be stored for future reference. The inventory application will be more reliable since it will keep the items of each product in a specific category and they will be displayed in a grid whenever the user wants to. I think with the MySQL database I can keep the product descriptions, dates added and other important information necessary for inventory. To finish, the previous application did not include a background and it didn’t seem to be attractive to the users. While going through each block of the code, I found it more interesting to add a background and have a different color scheme. These enhancements in the program has helped improving my skills in software design, data structure and database  since after the code review process I then had the opportunity to go through the project and with the help of the code review checklist I identified several mistakes, I then corrected them and hope they don’t happen in the future. </p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Although, I received feedback from the instructor on the progress with my application, but unfortunately for the last two weeks I have not been able to make too much enhancement on the application. I am still working on uploading the project in my ePortfolio, but before that I want to make sure that I link it to the chosen database. <br> For this ePortfolio project, I am using an inventory app that I built from scratch and the more I look over it, the more I realize I need to change. The inventory application includes a screen for the user login, with the option of creating an account if first time user. A grid that shows the inventory items in the warehouse with a mechanism to add and remove items in different categories. A screen that displays the items to be added to the grid of the database. Also, I wanted to have another mechanism that will send an alert to the user when a specific item reaches zero. <br> This course has helped me understand the software design more and how the database work with the application. However, I am still struggling on reaching this step as I am new to this and it becomes a challenge for me. As mentioned in my previous enhancement, the inventory application will be more reliable since it will keep the items of each product in a specific category and they will be displayed in a grid whenever the user wants to. I think with the MySQL database I can keep the product descriptions, dates added and other important information necessary for inventory. </p>
