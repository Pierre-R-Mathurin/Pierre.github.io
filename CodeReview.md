## Refinement Plan & Code Review

**Category One: Software Engineering/Design**

Software engineering/design is the process of developing software programs or applications to help achieving certain goals. Throughout my college career in the computer science program, I have acquired some knowledge and some best practices to develop and design computer applications.
One application that I created was an inventory app to track inventory in a warehouse. This was a simple program I did for school that was written in java programming language. The users had to login or create an account if never logged in before in order to access any content in the application. My plan in this course is to enhance this application by improving the logic flow and fix some of the possible logic errors. I also need to make sure that the mechanisms for adding and removing items from the inventory are properly stored.

**Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structures**

The algorithms and data structures for this application seem to be very simple. An algorithm is used to display the items from the inventory if the userâ€™s credentials are matched. That is after the user is logged in, all the items from the inventory are displayed then, he or she is prompted to three different options from the available mechanisms; add or remove items, increase or decrease items, then setting up alert when a specific item reaches zero. I plan on enhancing the algorithm to better retrieve information from the inventory by modifying the data structures using array lists to store the inventory items. Also, I want to write an algorithm for setting up the alert.

**Category Three: Databases**

I do not have much experience dealing with databases so I did not do any research on which best suits my application. Therefore, I plan to use the SQL database system to store the application data and I believe that it is capable to do the work due the variety of sources that it provides. Since multiple users may access the application, I planned to use the four functions, create, read, update, and delete to better assist the users and should help avoiding double entries or changes. That is when one user makes a change the system will not allow the same change to occur a second time in the same database.
